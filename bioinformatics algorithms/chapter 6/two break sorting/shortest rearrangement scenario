ShortestRearrangementScenario(P, Q)
     output P
     RedEdges ← ColoredEdges(P)
     BlueEdges ← ColoredEdges(Q)
     BreakpointGraph ← the graph formed by RedEdges and BlueEdges
     while BreakpointGraph has a non-trivial cycle Cycle
          (i1 , i2 , i3 , i4 ) ← path starting at arbitrary red edge in nontrivial red-blue cycle
          RedEdges ← RedEdges with edges (i1, i2) and (i3, i4) removed
          RedEdges ← RedEdges with edges (i1, i4) and (i2, i3) added
          BreakpointGraph ← the graph formed by RedEdges and BlueEdges
          P ← 2-BreakOnGenome(P, i1 , i2 , i4 , i3 )
          output P
